What changed in this repo and why, newest first. `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules
that stand; this file holds the evidence behind them.

## 2026-09-29 — blog#17: remove the PostHog snippet that never ran

**Decision.** The blog has no analytics. Stefan chose this on the board
(decision 386). buildforge.cloud dropped PostHog on 2026-09-11 so it needs no
cookie banner, and the blog now matches it. Search Console still gives the
blog's search numbers.

**Why the snippet never ran.** `src/layouts/Layout.astro` held it as a
`{'...' + "..."}` expression inside `<script is:inline>`. Astro prints an
expression there as text. The built page held `<script>{'!function(t,e){…`, so
the browser read a block with a string in it and did nothing. PostHog had 0
events from `blog.buildforge.cloud` in 365 days (measured 2026-09-29, in the
issue). The project key still shipped on every page.

**What was removed.**

- The snippet and its comment in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
- `https://eu.i.posthog.com` and `https://eu-assets.i.posthog.com` from the
  `script-src` and `connect-src` of the CSP in `nginx.conf`.
- The Analytics text in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`, now true.

A grep for `posthog` and `phc_` found nothing else: no env var, no preconnect,
no package, and no post that names it.

**The check.** `tests/analytics.spec.mjs` walks `dist/` and fails when a built
page's scripts, `src` URLs or `<link>` tags, or any built `.js` file, name
PostHog or hold a `phc_` key. On the code before this change it failed on all
24 pages. Prose and JSON-LD are not checked, on purpose: this blog writes about
the tools its apps use, and a post about this very issue would name PostHog.
The rule is in `tests/analytics.mjs`, and `tests/analytics.test.mjs` checks it
without a build, including that `nginx.conf` names no tracker. Seven mutations
of the rule each failed the test written for them.

**Found on the way, not fixed: the CSP never reaches a page.** `nginx.conf`
sets its security headers with `add_header` at `server` level. nginx drops
those in any `location` that has its own `add_header`, and the `.html` location
has one (`Cache-Control`). So pages get no CSP and no `Referrer-Policy`.
Measured 2026-09-29 with `curl -sI`: `https://blog.buildforge.cloud/` has
neither header; `/robots.txt`, whose location has no `add_header`, has both.
Whoever fixes this must also change the CSP itself: its `script-src` has no
`'unsafe-inline'`, and the built pages carry inline scripts (Astro's own
modules, giscus, and two `data-astro-rerun` blocks), so a CSP that reached the
pages as written would block them.
